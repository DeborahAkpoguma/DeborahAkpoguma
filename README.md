# Introduction
Hi, I‚Äôm Deborah. I am an aspiring self-taught data analyst with proficiency in Python, JavaScript, Excel, and SQL.

My passion for data analysis started as a hobby and has now turned into a career aspiration. Currently, I am working as an Office Support Assistant at MDOS Consulting, where I manage contracts and collaborate with team members to create and submit successful Request for Proposals responses.

Prior to my current role, I worked as a Junior Medical Writer/Researcher and Drug Editor/Reviewer at Thera-Business, where I summarized clinical study results, appraised studies for data contribution, and maintained the drug database using Microsoft Excel. I have also worked as a Client Care Coordinator at CBI Home Health, where I used scheduling software to fulfill patients' care plans, managed client profiles, and communicated with care providers to ensure schedules were carried out effectively and efficiently.

My experience in these roles has equipped me with excellent organizational and communication skills, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. I am eager to continue developing my skills in data analysis and work towards becoming a successful data analyst.
